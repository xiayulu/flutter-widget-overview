# [BaseLine](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Baseline-class.html)

> A widget that positions its child according to the child's baseline.
> 
> This widget shifts the child down such that the child's baseline (or the bottom of the child, if the child has no baseline) is [baseline](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Baseline/baseline.html) logical pixels below the top of this box, then sizes this box to contain the child. If [baseline](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Baseline/baseline.html) is less than the distance from the top of the child to the baseline of the child, then the child is top-aligned instead.
